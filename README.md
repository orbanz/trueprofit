Darwin's “survival of the fittest” theory explains the ecological crisis. In contrast to man’s ancestors, now, the fittest is the richest in terms of money. Financial profit increases exponentially along with planetary debt, since inferior products with negative climate impact are cheaper to produce and sell than sustainable products. The planet doesn't collect debts from an individual but from an entire society and with considerable delay. In other words; the current economy encourages eco-damage rather than eco-accountability. Considering the nature of the fittest in society, we believe that in order to promote eco-accountability and human wealth, our economy needs to redefine the concept of profit. 


We want to develop a framework for true profit calculation, based on the existing model of planetary accounting. To redefine the capitalist model and match the actual variables (including the eco-cost).To inventorize the needs for a decent life (to underpin a holistic approach to basic income). A framework that is beneficial enough to society to actually stand a chance against the current economic reality of unfair competition (by launching a cryptocurrency and monetising planetary profit).


It presumes that consumers lack freedom of choice because they lack the resources to pay for the most sustainable option, when there is a cheaper alternative.  The human urge for self-preservation is greater than the urge for planetary preservation, although there is an imminent co-dependency between both. Such a framework could help consumers make sustainable choices by

 1) making planetary preservation a benchmark for profit

 2) monetising this profit through a new cryptocurrency and 

 3) providing a guaranteed fulfilment of basic needs, alongside the monetary system as we know it today. 


The core concept is built around a mechanism- adopting current monetary policy logic and methods- that accepts that neither the consumer, nor the producer or the state will pay the calculated social and planetary costs, instead it monetises the planetary costs not made for a particular product compared to the market standard.

In today’s economy it should operate as a virtual invisible hand closing the gaps of unfair competition between A, companies making huge financial profits by operating at high social and planetary costs, and B operating at low social and planetary costs and low financial profits.

Pain points and user stories 
 
Who are your constituents, clients and users?  
 
 
 1) People in need of basic goods and services. 
 
 2) Responsible consumers  supporting sustainable Economy  
 
 3) Sustainable,circular businesses growing towards zero waste production  
 
 4) Social, public and institutional actors promoting a more sustainable, horizontal, participative, open source, transparent, inclusive, consensus, bottom up, circular, social, artistic society.   
 
User pain points  
 
  
 
 There Still are too many people whos basic rights and needs are not properly met. 
 
2/3  of consumers  lack financial resources or motivation to pay the extra cost of environmental premium goods and services. 
 
Except for the energy sector, the so needed sustainable alternatives,to address the climate crisis, still hold a (very)limited share of the market.Business models that don't integrate, reduce or avoid environmental and social costs still dominate the market. Companies who make efforts to reduce their footprint also make more costs doing this and thus make less profit. Markets are dominated  by the companies making the most profit .A long history of government ,taxes and regulation put us here in the first place and is not able, willing nor likely to solve it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our Value proposition 
 
 If we want to stand a chance in the ecological and climate crises we need to introduce disruptive  economic models and redefine profit. We need a system  to valorize and reward sustainability instead. 
We support and monitor human and environmental needs by making them clear and connecting them In a circular community-driven platform. We use True cost accounting and environmental full cost accounting frameworks, both approved by and adopted in the UN SDG’s. These inform us about average environmental and social costs of goods and services. In our decentralized value creating mechanism we compare average eco costs to those of our participants sustainable products.The Net environmental benefits equal the environmental costs we avoided compared to buying the average product.By doing so we make eco-accountabillity a benchmark for profit.Benefits are monetized in a cryptocurrency and redistributed between social,environmental and economical stakeholders by a user voting mechanism. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Our distribution and go-to-market strategy  
 
Our solution is designed to integrate or emulate multiple already existing platforms operating on blockchain,First we build Partnerships with experienced actors in the field, Manna blockchain for Universal basic income, Foodchain transparent supply chains,the UN SDG’s framework, TCA/EFCA/FCA frameworks. 
 
 
Risks associated with our solution 
 
 
The adoption of the core value creating mechanism By central banks In a centralized, top bottom structure, to avert a financial crisis and support business as usual instead of using it as a tool to build resilient communities and bridge the gaps between society, ecology and economy. 
 
 
How do we measure the impact of our solution? 
 
The impact is measured in a triple bottom line.  
 
1)  environmental profits; we only support actors that take in account all environmental and social costs,whence these costs are reduced and avoided by responsible and intelligent business models communities and ecosystems can thrive again. 
 
2) social profits; by effectively redistributing environmental profits among the different actors of the community.  
 
3) Financial profit for transparent sustainable models. 

Define specific problem you are addressing

We wish to address to problem of  unsustainable profit and production by using the planetary cost accounting framework which includes all currently externalized costs to planet and society.when this is taken as a or the norm for calculating profit and a currency to monetize them Zero waste economy would be many times more profitable than the linear waste economy.

Blockchain heavy technology is needed because we will try to thoroughly test its capacity to fluidly combine multiple decentralized ledgers dynamically together, ranging from direct liquid participative democracy ,transparent production ledgers, planetary accounting frameworks to calculate planetary profit and monetize thru a cryptocurrency ,automated user feedback integration.I don’t know any other technology able to do this job.

We wish to serve humans between the age of 8 or 18 (depending on the decisions of the participators) and ∞. We believe the potential of the project ranges from small local p2p networks to a global community.

Currently there are two different approaches addressing this problem of unsustainable products and profit.The first approach is to gather and analyze all planetary costs and transform them into new taxes to keep business as usual and ‘repair’ the eco-damage made in the production process of the product with the collected tax money. The other strategy is to innovate and avoid planetary and social costs and operated close to zero waste production. Many systems like direct an liquid democracy, transparent production control systems, planetary costs accounting, and cryptocurrencies are or could be running on blockchain technology, so its just putting parts together.
Access to network is still a considerable problem but many forces are working on this subject , maybe this initiative could create some new possibilities on this matter .
So many Different people in different parts of the world  obviously have different basic needs to have a decent life.
If we monetize the planetary profit globally than there is more profit to be made where there now are more planetary costs, Whether this is fair or which kind of correctional factor should be used to correct this, and many other inequality matters, are very good subject for discussion and science.
