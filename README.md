# True profit calculator


True profit calculation as a solution for eco-accountability and human wealth


Darwin's “survival of the fittest” theory explains the ecological crisis. In contrast to man’s ancestors, now, the fittest is the richest in terms of money. Financial profit increases exponentially along with planetary debt, since inferior products with negative climate impact are cheaper to produce and sell than sustainable products. The planet doesn't collect debts from an individual but from an entire society and with considerable delay. In other words; the current economy encourages eco-damage rather than eco-accountability. Considering the nature of the fittest in society, we believe that in order to promote eco-accountability and human wealth, our economy needs to redefine the concept of profit. 


We want to develop a framework for true profit calculation, based on the existing model of planetary accounting. To redefine the capitalist model and match the actual variables (including the eco-cost).To inventorize the needs for a decent life (to underpin a holistic approach to basic income). A framework that is beneficial enough to society to actually stand a chance against the current economic reality of unfair competition (by launching a cryptocurrency and monetising planetary profit).


It presumes that consumers lack freedom of choice because they lack the resources to pay for the most sustainable option, when there is a cheaper alternative.  The human urge for self-preservation is greater than the urge for planetary preservation, although there is an imminent co-dependency between both. Such a framework could help consumers make sustainable choices by

 1) making planetary preservation a benchmark for profit

 2) monetising this profit through a new cryptocurrency and 

 3) providing a guaranteed fulfilment of basic needs, alongside the monetary system as we know it today. 


The core concept is built around a mechanism- adopting current monetary policy logic and methods- that accepts that neither the consumer, nor the producer or the state will pay the calculated social and planetary costs, instead it monetises the planetary costs not made for a particular product compared to the market standard.

In today’s economy it should operate as a virtual invisible hand closing the gaps of unfair competition between A, companies making huge financial profits by operating at high social and planetary costs, and B operating at low social and planetary costs and low financial profits.
